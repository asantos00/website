This is the introduction for a blog post series where we'll use [Deno](https://deno.land) to build different applications going from CLIs to web scrapping tools, among others.

If you're not familiar with Deno, here's the [TLDR](/deno/tldr). If you have heard about Deno and are here to know more about it, letâ€™s not waste any more of your time.

Here's what we'll cover on the upcoming posts: 

- [Building a CLI with Deno](/deno/build-a-cli-with-deno)
- Using Deno with Puppeteer
- Building a Deno plugin, the interoperability with Rust
- Static site generation in Deno, with aleph.js
- ...

*Most of these posts are written in collaboration with friends working in the industry. I believe this will make such posts more interesting -- as these are people with completely different backgrounds and experiences.*

We'll use these example applications to explore Deno and how it can be applied to common tasks. By the end of it, you will have a better understanding of this new JavaScript runtime and how it can be used.

From now on it is up to you. 

The above posts do not require to be read in any specific order, but if you want a suggestion, you can start by [Creating a CLI with Deno](/deno/build-a-cli-with-deno) written by my friend [Joni Oliveira]() and me.

I hope you find it interesting.

Best,

*If there is any Deno related topic you're interested in reading or writing about, I'd be happy to help.*
