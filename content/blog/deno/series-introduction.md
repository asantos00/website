This is the introduction for a blog post series where we'll use [Deno](https://deno.land) to build different applications going from CLIs to web scrapping tools, among others.

If you're not familiar with Deno, here's the [TLDR](/deno/tldr). If you at least have heard of Deno and you are here to know more about it, let's not waste you more time.

Here's what we'll cover on the upcoming posts: 

- [Creating a CLI with Deno](/deno/build-a-cli-with-deno)
- Using Deno with Puppeteer
- Building a Deno plugin, the interoperability with Rust
- Static site generation in Deno, with aleph.js
- ...

*Most of these posts are written in collaboration with friends working in the industry. I believe this will make such posts more interesting -- as these are people with completely different backgrounds and experiences.*

We'll use these example applications to explore Deno and how it can be applied to common tasks. By the end of it, you will have a better understanding of this new JavaScript runtime and how it can be used.

## Let's start!

From now on it is up to you. 

The above posts do not require to be read in any specific order, but if you want a suggestion, you can start by [Creating a CLI with Deno](/deno/build-a-cli-with-deno) written by my friend [Joni Oliveira]() and me.

I hope you find it interesting.

Best,

*If there is any Deno related topic you're interested in reading or writing about, I'd be happy to help.*
