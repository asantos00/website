This is the introduction for a blog post series where we'll use [Deno](https://deno.land) to build different applications going from CLIs to web scrapping tools, among others.

If you're not familiar with Deno, here's the [TLDR](/deno/tldr). If you have heard about Deno and are here to know more about it, let’s not waste any more of your time.

Here's what we'll cover in the upcoming posts: 

- [Building a CLI with Deno](/deno/build-a-cli-with-deno)
- [Using Deno with Puppeteer](/deno/puppeteer-with-deno)
- [Creating a Deno plugin with Rust](/deno/creating-a-deno-plugin)
- Static site generation in Deno, with aleph.js
- ...

*I wrote these posts in collaboration with some friends who work in the industry. I believe this will make such posts more interesting -- as these are people with completely different backgrounds and experiences.*

We'll use these example applications to explore Deno and how to use it to perform common tasks. By the end of it, you will have a better understanding of how to use this new JavaScript runtime.

From now on it is up to you. 

The above posts do not require to be read in any specific order, but if you want a suggestion, you can start by [Creating a CLI with Deno](/deno/build-a-cli-with-deno) written by my friend [Joni Oliveira]() and me.

I hope you find it interesting and have some fun while exploring these posts. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ampsantos0)!

*If there is any Deno-related topic you're interested in reading or writing about, I'd be happy to help.*
